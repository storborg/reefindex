  "description": "This is an eel that goes through different color and pattern changes as it grows into maturity, but primarily with its bright yellow, orange-red, black and white colorations, unusual patterns on the body, sharp pointed head and distinctive horns above the eyes, it is without a doubt an eel that cannot be mistaken for any other.",

  "range": "Extends from Hawai'i to southern Japan, and southward to central Polynesia, or the Indo-Pacific region.",

  "diet": "A carnivore, this eel will try to eat anything it can get its mouth around. It is a hunter and prefers to dine on live foods, such as small fish, crabs, shrimps, and squids. In captivity it may be difficult to get this eel to eat at first, with larger specimens sometimes not eating for several months.\nProviding this eel with live feeder fish may help to stimulate its natural feeding instincts, and once adjusted to tank life it may begin to accept strips of fish flesh, such as smelt, haddock, orange roughy, as well as squid.\nAs with most all eels, foods are best offered directly to this eel on a feeding stick, and it should only be fed when it wants to eat. In all likelihood this will be a couple of times a week, or even up to several weeks in between feedings, and then only feed the eel as much as it will consume at one time.\nFrom time to time it is not uncommon for the Dragon Moray Eel, as do most all other eels, to go into a \"hibernation\" period, at which time it will usually hide and not eat for several weeks, or longer.",
